# Restaurant Review App (Stage 1)

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the this project, I incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. We had to take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. We also had to add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### How to Run it

1. Download or clone the git repository.

2. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
